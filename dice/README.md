# dice

## Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce you to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps youâ€™ll build in the future. This app will teach you how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.


## Output
![Finished App](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Images/blob/master/dicee-demo.gif)

## Expanded
Must be a descendant of a Row, Column or Flex, Expanded makes its child expand to fill the available space in the main axis.

## FlatButton
This widget cames with a 15.0 padding by default

## dart data types
Dart is a Statically Typed Language, a variable data type can not be changed, but the variable value can.

- String: inside ' '
- int: numbers, positive or nombers
- double: numbers with a decimal point
- bool: hold onlye one of these 2 values **true** or **false**
- dynamic: a variable without a fixed data type.

## Stateful

Used when the app changes its state, when we want to update the screen.
Hot Reload?

The element marked as #dirty will be cleaned (updated)
